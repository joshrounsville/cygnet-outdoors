            <p class="pad-b"><i class="icon icon-drop-c dropcap"></i><span class="highlight">reated by Bekah Klarr, Cygnet Outdoors is the online home to an outdoor life. After finishing school in 2010, Bekah started to further explore her diverse interests. She worked on the family cattle ranch in rural Nevada,</span> trained as a wilderness EMT, and earned her private pilot's license. Also during this time Bekah continued to develop a love for spending time outdoors hunting and fishing. In 2012 Bekah worked as an editor for her mother's first published book and soon after started to write for various publications with the goal of bringing more representation to the hunting community. A lifelong seeker of new experiences and wild places, since childhood, Bekah had been writing small poems, sketching little drawings, and snapping photos everyday. As she continued to be inspired by rural places and outdoor adventures an idea formed to create a space for her projects and writings. Cygnet Outdoors was created for this purpose - an online home to an outdoor life.</p>
